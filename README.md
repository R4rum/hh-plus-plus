# Rarum's Hacky HH++ Tweaks

# Installation instructions:

a) Install ViolentMonkey, TamperMonkey or Greasemonkey (Firefox addon)
b) Click the script URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/R4rum/hh-plus-plus/main/dist/hh-plus-plus.user.js
c) Your user script manager of choice should automatically prompt you to install/update the script. If it doesn't, well, figure it out.

# What this changes
* The market equips filter module has greatly improved speed, at the cost of usability
* The legacy home screen layout has been modified to make room for a larger girl image
* A different temporary PoP order
* PoPs have only girls of matching class displayed by default
